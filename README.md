# Next.js mock API

Next.js api for practice angular projects.

## Getting Started

First add DATABASE_URL to your .env file. Eg:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="file:../db.sqlite"
```

note\*: "file:" part of the database url is absolutely necessary if you plan on using sqlite database.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
